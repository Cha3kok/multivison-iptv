        heading: "1. IPTV Smarters Pro",
        body: "IPTV Smarters Pro is the most popular choice for Firestick users. It supports M3U playlists and Xtream Codes, has a clean interface, and includes catch-up TV, EPG, and a built-in video player. The free version is fully functional — the pro upgrade just removes ads. Setup takes under two minutes.",

        heading: "2. TiviMate",
        body: "TiviMate is widely considered the best IPTV player for Android TV and Firestick. Its TV-like interface makes it perfect for living room viewing. The free version is solid, but the premium version (around £4/year) adds multiple playlists, recording, and catch-up. It's our top pick for daily use.",

        body: "IPTV stands for Internet Protocol Television. In simple terms, it means watching TV channels delivered over the internet rather than through a traditional aerial, satellite dish, or cable connection. Instead of receiving a broadcast signal, your TV content is streamed to you just like YouTube or Netflix.",

        heading: "How Does IPTV Work?",

The app connects to our servers and streams the live channels, catch-up content, and video-on-demand library directly to your screen.",

The legality depends on the content provider — licensed services are legal, while unlicensed streams of copyrighted channels are not. Always use a reputable, licensed provider.",

        heading: "IPTV vs Traditional TV",

IPTV typically costs under £10/month, works on any device you already own, and has no contracts. The channel selection is often larger too, with international channels included.",

        body: "Wi-Fi is convenient but unreliable for streaming. If possible, connect your streaming device directly to your router with an ethernet cable. This alone resolves buffering for most users. If you must use Wi-Fi, move closer to your router or use a Wi-Fi extender.",

        heading: "5. Server Load at Peak Times",
        body: "Some IPTV providers cut corners on server capacity. At peak times (evenings, big match days) their servers get overwhelmed. We maintain excess server capacity specifically to prevent this. If you consistently buffer at the same times, your provider's servers may be the problem.",
